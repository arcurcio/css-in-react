# Talk ideas
- Learning from other languages and other frameworks. From other developers. Student of core concepts not frameworks.
- From next.js README
    - Why CSS-in-JS?
        - next/css is powered by Glamor. While it exposes a JavaScript API, it produces regular CSS and therefore important features like :hover, animations, media queries all work.
        - Thereâ€™s no tradeoff in power. Instead, we gain the power of simpler composition and usage of JavaScript expressions.
        - Compiling regular CSS files would be counter-productive to some of our goals. Some of these are listed below.
        - Please note: we are very interested in supporting regular CSS, since it's so much easier to write and already familiar. To that end, we're currently exploring the possibility of leveraging Shadow DOM to avoid the entire CSS parsing and mangling step [#22]

# Webpack
- file loader - generates files with hashes, can set a min size limit
- url loader - creates inline data URLs for small resources
- image loader - compress images
- css loader - finds import and url() statements and turns them into require
- style loader - style loader injects the resulting css into the bundle, JSON to style
